To run the code the user will need to set up a python environment with Tweepy and JSON installed. 

After that is complete they with need to make sure all python scripts and the COVID Twitter data folder are in the same directory.

From there they would just need to run the twitter_analysis.py script and let it run as long as they would like. 

Once complete all results will be stored in results.txt
