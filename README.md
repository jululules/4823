To run the code the user will need to set up a python environment with Tweepy and JSON installed. 

After that is complete they will need to make sure all python scripts and the COVID Twitter data folder are in the same directory.

From there they would just need to run the twitter_analysis.py script with python3 and let it run as long as they would like. Be
warned that this script can run for well over 24 hours since there is a lot of data to scrape and analyze. 

Once complete all results will be stored in results.txt
